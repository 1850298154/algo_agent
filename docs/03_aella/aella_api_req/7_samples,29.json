This study provides a sub-Saharan Africa perspective by documenting the social consequences of COVID-19 and its relationship to fertility preference stability and modern contraceptive use in Nigeria.\nWe analysed panel data collected by Performance Monitoring for Action in Nigeria. Baseline and Follow-up surveys were conducted before the COVID-19 outbreak (November 2019-February 2020) and during the lockdown respectively (May-July 2020). Analysis was restricted to married non-pregnant women during follow-up (n = 774). Descriptive statistics and generalized linear models were employed to explore the relationship between selected social consequences of COVID-19 and fertility preferences stability (between baseline and follow-up) as well as modern contraceptives use.\nReported social consequences of the pandemic lockdown include total loss of household income (31.3%), food insecurity (16.5%), and greater economic reliance on partner (43.0%). Sixty-eight women (8.8%) changed their minds about pregnancy and this was associated with age groups, higher wealth quintile (AOR = 0.38, CI: 0.15-0.97) and household food insecurity (AOR = 2.72, CI: 1.23-5.99). Fertility preference was inconsistent among 26.1%. Women aged 30-34 years (AOR = 4.46, CI:1.29-15.39) were more likely of inconsistent fertility preference compared to 15-24 years. The likelihood was also higher among women with three children compared to those with only one child (AOR = 3.88, CI: 1.36-11.08). During follow-up survey, 59.4% reported they would feel unhappy if pregnant. This was more common among women with tertiary education (AOR = 2.99, CI: 1.41-6.33). The odds increased with parity. The prevalence of modern contraceptive use was 32.8%. Women aged 45-49 years (AOR = 0.24, CI: 0.10-0.56) were less likely to use modern contraceptives than those aged 15-24 years. In contrast, the odds of contraceptive use were significantly higher among those with three (AOR = 1.82, CI: 1.03-3.20), four (AOR = 2.45, CI: 1.36-4.39) and at least five\npdf_parse: {''paper_id'': ''8y_VwVyeozUJ'', ''_pdf_hash'': '''', ''abstract'': [{''text'': ''Background: Emerging evidence from high income countries showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has had negative effects on population and reproductive health behaviour.

The fragile health system and weak economic base in SSA exacerbated the hardship occasioned by lockdown and other containment measures [5] . These multiplier effects have been reported to have negative outlooks for health indices such as sexual and reproductive health (SRH), maternal and child health (MCH), as well as HIV care and treatment services [6] .

In the pandemic era, studies conducted in Australia [15] , United Kingdom [16] , the United States [17] , Italy [18] , Poland [19] and Shanghai, China [20] revealed that on the average, about one-third of women or couples who planned pregnancy for Jan-July 2020 postponed their pregnancy intention mostly due to concerns about income loss, access to MCH services and possible effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy.

In contrast, the percentage undecided about future childbirth was higher in 2013 compared to 2003 and was associated with parity and discrepancies in desired family sizes among couples [23] . We hypothesise that COVID-19 and its attendant adverse economic effects may heighten the level of uncertainty. Therefore, reproductive-age women may have inconsistent childbearing desires, especially during the lockdown restrictions. To explore these issues, our study aimed to address the following objectives: (i) assess the social consequences of COVID-19 among married women in Nigeria; (ii) investigate short-term changes in childbearing intentions due to COVID-19 concerns; (iii) explore the relationship between social consequences of COVID-19 and stability of fertility preference, and (iv) investigate the implication of social consequences of COVID-19 and stability of fertility preference on modern contraceptive use among married women in Nigeria.

It has been hypothesized that in LMIC countries, childbearing intentions or fertility preferences may change because of economic and social changes brought by the pandemic. Consequently, fertility may increase or reduce depending on other factors such as access to contraception [8] . Apart from disruption of reproductive health services, which is being tackled, early evidence from SSA suggest that uptake or use of contraceptives has not suffered any downward trend [10, 11] .

The proportion of women who changed their pregnancy intention is far less than what has been reported in some developed countries, where at least one-third opted to postpone pregnancy/childbearing due to COVID-19 and its attendant economic hardship [16] [17] [18] . The difference in the percentage of women who changed minds about pregnancy is not surprising because the contexts differ in various ways. For instance, the two settings are in different stages of demographic transition, with Nigeria being in the high fertility phase. Besides, fertility aspirations are higher in Nigeria than in many developed countries. The difference in change of pregnancy intentions may also have reflected the COVID-19 contexts. Obviously, the pandemic has had a greater impact in terms of mortality and morbidity in developed countries than in SSA and Nigeria in particular [8] . Historical evidence suggests that in the short term, after a pandemic or natural disaster or any other population shock, birth rates are usually lower but may pick up later [8] . The fact that household food security and economic reliance on partner was significantly related to change in pregnancy intention among Nigerian women shows the devastating effects of the pandemic on socio-economic status. This finding is consistent with prior evidence in another SSA country [36] . Perhaps, fears that pregnancy will bring additional children and extra mouth to be fed makes people change their minds. This is expected in a setting where poverty is ravaging. Furthermore, our results showed that about one-quarter of study participants had inconsistent fertility preferences within a short space of 6 months. This was common in age 25-39 years, and the odds increased with the number of CEB and household food insecurity. The literature on fertility preferences in SSA suggests that childbearing desire is rarely constant but changes with people\\''s circumstances [14, 37, 38] . The pattern of changes showed that women with \"undecided\" fertility preference at baseline constituted a large portion of those found to have inconsistent fertility preference. The fact that the odds of inconsistent fertility preference increased with CEB suggests that the women had challenges in setting fertility goals and sticking to it.

In multivariable models, women in the lower (AOR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.14â0.76) and higher (AOR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.15â0.97) wealth quintiles were less likely to change intention than the lowest quintile, while household food insecurity was associated with higher odds (AOR = 2.72, 95% CI: 1.23â5.99). Inconsistent fertility preference was observed in 26.1% of women; ages 30â34 (AOR = 4.46, 95% CI: 1.29â15.39) and women with three CEB (AOR = 3.88, 95% CI: 1.36â11.08) relative to one CEB had higher odds. During follow-up, 59.4% reported they would feel unhappy if pregnant; tertiary education (AOR = 2.99, 95% CI: 1.41â6.33) and higher parity increased odds of being unhappy. Modern contraceptive use prevalence was 32.8% at follow-up; women aged 45â49 had lower odds than ages 15â24 (AOR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.10â0.56), while higher parity (3 CEB: AOR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.03â3.20; 4 CEB: AOR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.36â4.39; â¥5 CEB: AOR = 2.89, 95% CI: 1.25â6.74) and an unhappy disposition (AOR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.72â3.58) were associated with higher odds of use. Notably, none of the social consequences of COVID-19 were independently associated with modern contraceptive use.\\n\\nFindings suggest that economic shocks and food insecurity were linked to unstable fertility intentions, whereas contraceptive use patterns were more strongly associated with background characteristics and emotional disposition to pregnancy. The study provides early evidence from Nigeria that, despite pandemic-related disruptions, contraceptive use did not decline and that unhappiness about pregnancy may be a promising lever for family planning promotion. Limitations include short-term follow-up during peak lockdown, telephone-based follow-up, potential selection bias, and lack of sexual behavior data. The results are context-specific to Lagos and Kano and should not be generalized to Nigeria as a whole.\",\n    \"research_context\": \"Early in the pandemic, lockdowns and service disruptions raised concerns about adverse impacts on sexual and reproductive health in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), including potential increases in unintended pregnancies and maternal morbidity/mortality. Prior high-income country studies reported substantial postponement of pregnancy intentions due to economic and service disruptions. In contrast, emerging SSA evidence suggested contraceptive use remained stable or increased in some settings, with context and socio-economic differences. Nigeria, a high-fertility SSA country, had not yet experienced the same magnitude of mortality as high-income countries. The study addresses a gap by providing population-based evidence from Nigeria on how COVID-19-related social consequences relate to fertility preference stability and modern contraceptive use, complementing longitudinal findings from Kenya and Burkina Faso and informing SDG3 family planning targets. It also explores whether pandemic-era emotional disposition to pregnancy correlates with contraceptive uptake, offering a potential behavioral lever for family planning communication.\",\n    \"research_question_and_hypothesis\": \"Research questions: (i) What were the social consequences of COVID-19 among married women in Nigeria? (ii) Did COVID-19 concerns lead to short-term changes in childbearing intentions? (iii) How were social consequences of COVID-19 associated with stability of fertility preferences? (iv) What were the implications of social consequences and fertility preference stability for modern contraceptive use?\\n\\nHypotheses: The authors hypothesized that adverse economic effects of COVID-19 would heighten uncertainty and lead to inconsistent childbearing desires, particularly during lockdown. They further anticipated that background characteristics (age, education, employment, wealth, parity) would continue to shape fertility preferences and contraceptive use, and that emotional disposition to pregnancy might be associated with contraceptive uptake. Outcomes supporting the hypotheses would include higher odds of changing pregnancy intention and inconsistent preferences among those experiencing economic hardship (e.g., food insecurity), and associations between parity and education with contraceptive use. Null findings for social consequences predicting contraceptive use would suggest resilience of contraceptive behavior to pandemic-related shocks.\",\n    \"methodological_details\": \"Design and setting: Population-based panel survey using PMA data in Lagos and Kano States, Nigeria, two of the most populous states. The first COVID-19 case in Nigeria was detected in late February 2020; by 6 September 2021, Nigeria had 195,890 cases and a 1.3% case fatality rate. Lagos (epicenter) recorded 74,044 cases and 648 deaths; Kano had 4,102 cases and 111 deaths. Total lockdown and interstate travel restrictions were implemented nationwide between May and July 2020.\\n\\nData sources and sampling: PMA conducts representative surveys across SSA and Southeast Asia. In Nigeria, four rounds have been conducted since 2017. This study used baseline (Dec 2019âJan 2020) and follow-up (MayâJuly 2020) rounds. Sampling employed a multi-stage stratified cluster design in 52 enumeration areas (EAs) in Lagos and 25 EAs in Kano, with females aged 15â49 selected. Baseline data collection was face-to-face; follow-up used telephone interviews among baseline respondents who consented to recontact and had a phone. Follow-up samples were 82.6% (Lagos) and 33.6% (Kano) of baseline populations.\\n\\nAnalytic sample: Of 1,603 eligible for follow-up (Lagos: 1,174; Kano: 429), 1,346 were successfully interviewed. The analytic sample included a reverse-weighted subset of 774 married (married or cohabiting with a man) and non-pregnant women during follow-up. Pregnant women were excluded because they did not respond to intention/outcome measures.\\n\\nOutcomes: (i) Change in pregnancy intention due to COVID-19 concerns: dichotomous (1 = changed; 0 = consistent), defined by discordance between baseline and follow-up responses to pregnancy intention categories. (ii) Inconsistent fertility preference: dichotomous (1 = inconsistent; 0 = consistent) between baseline and follow-up. (iii) Disposition to pregnancy: dichotomous (happy vs unhappy) based on follow-up response to feeling if pregnant now. (iv) Modern contraceptive use: dichotomous (1 = user; 0 = non-user) of modern methods.\\n\\nExposures: Social consequences of COVID-19 (follow-up): loss of personal income (small, moderate, large, none), loss of household income (partial, total; none not selected), worry about future household finance (yes/no), household food insecurity (yes/no), economic reliance on partner (yes/no). Socio-demographics: age (15â24, 25â29, 30â34, 35â39, 40â44, 45â49), highest education (none, primary, secondary, tertiary), employment (yes/no), residence (urban/rural), wealth quintile (lowest, lower, middle, higher, highest; derived via PCA of household assets). Marital/reproductive: number of times married/cohabited (once vs more than once), family type (monogamy vs polygyny), children ever born (CEB: â¤1, 2, 3, 4, â¥5), history of pregnancy termination in past 3 years (yes/no).\\n\\nStatistical analysis: Descriptive statistics summarized characteristics and outcomes. For change in pregnancy intention (rare outcome), a complementary log-log model was used; for other outcomes, binomial logit models were applied. Model building proceeded in stages: (1) univariate models (one variable at a time) to estimate unadjusted ORs; (2) multivariable models including all social consequences; (3) final models including variables with p<0.1 from univariate and stage two.

Marital profile: 90.3% married/cohabited once; 21.1% polygynous. CEB distribution was even across â¤1, 2, 3, 4, â¥5; 9.0% reported a pregnancy termination in the past 3 years.\\n\\nSocial consequences: Moderate to large loss of personal income was reported by about half; total loss of household income by 31.3%; household food insecurity by 16.5%; 92.4% worried about future household finance; 43.0% became more economically reliant on their partner.\\n\\nChange in pregnancy intention: 68/774 (8.8%) changed their minds. Univariate associations included lower odds with higher age and wealth quintiles, and higher odds with food insecurity and partner reliance. In multivariable models, lower (AOR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.14â0.76) and higher (AOR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.15â0.97) wealth quintiles were less likely to change intention than the lowest quintile; household food insecurity increased odds (AOR = 2.72, 95% CI: 1.23â5.99).

Household food insecurity was associated with higher odds in intermediate models (AOR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.01â2.68) but not in the final model.\\n\\nDisposition to pregnancy: 59.4% reported they would feel unhappy if pregnant. Tertiary education (AOR = 2.99, 95% CI: 1.41â6.33) and higher parity increased odds of being unhappy; urban residence was associated with higher odds (AOR = 2.99 in unadjusted; adjusted AOR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.25â1.30). Loss of personal income categories were associated with lower odds of being unhappy in adjusted models (e.g., moderate AOR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.22â0.89; large AOR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.23â0.93).\\n\\nModern contraceptive use (MCP): Prevalence was 32.8% at follow-up (30.1% baseline; +2.7 percentage points). MCP peaked at ages 35â39 (41.0%) and was lowest at 45â49 (23.2%). Education increased MCP (none 15.5% vs tertiary 41.3%). Urban residence was associated with higher odds (unadjusted OR = 2.63; adjusted OR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.17â1.79).

None of the social consequences of COVID-19 were independently associated with MCP.\\n\\nComparative patterns: Baseline vs follow-up intention stability showed that 81.6% of women who wanted another child at baseline remained so; 47.2% of undecided at baseline wanted a child at follow-up, while 26.7% remained undecided. MCP was higher among women with an unhappy disposition (41.5%) than those happy (19.3%).\",\n    \"interpretation_and_theoretical_implications\": \"Economic shocks and food insecurity during COVID-19 were linked to unstable fertility intentions among Nigerian women, consistent with theories that fertility preferences are sensitive to household economic conditions. The lack of association between social consequences and modern contraceptive use suggests resilience of contraceptive behavior to pandemic-related disruptions, aligning with SSA evidence that contraceptive uptake did not decline. The strong association between unhappy disposition to pregnancy and higher odds of contraceptive use indicates that emotional readiness and ideational profiles are actionable levers for family planning promotion. Background factors (age, education, parity) maintained expected relationships with fertility preferences and contraceptive use, reinforcing established demographic patterns. The findings imply that communication strategies emphasizing emotional preparedness for pregnancy could enhance contraceptive uptake, while targeted support for food-insecure households may stabilize fertility intentions. The scope is limited to Lagos and Kano and short-term lockdown conditions; generalization to Nigeriaâs national context requires caution.\",\n    \"contradictions_and_limitations\": \"Key limitations include: (1) Short-term follow-up during peak lockdown; medium- and long-term fertility and contraceptive trajectories remain unknown. (2) Telephone-based follow-up may differ from face-to-face interviews, though the authors argue patterns are unlikely to change. (3) Selection bias: not all baseline respondents were recontacted; Kano had substantial dropout (33.6% follow-up), potentially biasing estimates upward if those consenting were more educated/wealthy. (4) Lack of sexual behavior data precludes assessing whether changes in sexual activity mediated effects on intentions or contraceptive use. (5) External validity: Lagos and Kano represent extremes of modern contraceptive prevalence in Nigeria; results should not be generalized nationally. (6) Some model coefficients differ slightly across tables (e.g., MCP age 45â49 AOR 0.24 vs 0.24 in text), indicating minor inconsistencies in reporting.
