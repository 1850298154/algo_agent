The motivation is to provide a scalable, non-destructive, and timely monitoring tool for maize growth and yield under climate variability, addressing limitations of destructive sampling and simulation models. The authors conducted a long-term UAV campaign over 20 experimental plots (10 m × 8 m) at the Eco-Agricultural Experimental Station (North China Plain) with varying N, P, K, straw, and organic fertilizer treatments. Eleven flights (July 7–September 30, 2019) captured RGB imagery at 50 m altitude, with four RTK-measured ground control points (GCPs) and standardized flight parameters (forward overlap 85%, side overlap 80%). Mosaics achieved a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 0.018 m. Chlorophyll was measured with SPAD-502 using a five-point method (center and four corners) the day after flights; yields were measured at maturity by harvesting and weighing dry matter.\\n\\nEight vegetation indices (VIs), including the proposed MRBVI (E8), were computed from normalized RGB bands. For chlorophyll estimation, average VI per plot per date was regressed against SPAD; for yield prediction, average VI per plot was regressed against plot yield. Across 11 growth stages, MRBVI achieved the highest average R² for chlorophyll estimation (0.462) and yield prediction (0.570), outperforming seven commonly used VIs (e.g., E1: 0.235 and 0.336; E2: 0.380 and 0.441; E3: 0.295 and 0.404; E4: 0.392 and 0.446; E5: 0.391 and 0.452; E6: 0.378 and 0.429; E7: 0.451 and 0.552). Relative error (RE) for MRBVI was the lowest at 0.355. VI–phenology relationships strengthened from mid-season onward (R² > 0.8 for chlorophyll and yield from July 28 to September 30), while early stages (July 7–22) showed weaker correlations.\\n\\nFor yield prediction, the authors trained BP, SVM, RF, and ELM models using leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation with eight VIs as predictors and plot yields as targets. SVM achieved the best performance (RMSE 1.099; MAE 0.886 g/hundred grain weight), followed by RF (RMSE 1.146; MAE 0.925), ELM (RMSE 1.698; MAE 1.356), and BP (RMSE 2.157; MAE 1.739). ELM was faster than BP by ~7% (332.860 s vs 355.250 s). Pixel-based scale-up using trained models produced yield maps that were closest to measured yields for SVM. The authors attribute MRBVI’s advantage to enhanced sensitivity of the red band to chlorophyll, consistent with prior literature.\\n\\nKey limitations include weak early-stage performance, small sample size (20 plots), lack of external validation, and missing MRBVI formula details. The work demonstrates that MRBVI integrated with ML, particularly SVM, can provide accurate chlorophyll estimation and yield prediction from UAV RGB imagery, with potential for operational monitoring and management.\", \"research_context\": \"Vegetation indices (VIs) derived from remote sensing are widely used to monitor crop growth and predict yields, offering non-destructive, scalable alternatives to destructive sampling and simulation models. Traditional destructive sampling is precise but impractical for large areas; simulation models require high-quality ground data. UAV-based RGB imagery provides high temporal and spatial resolution with reduced cloud interference compared to satellite remote sensing. Prior studies have shown SPAD readings correlate with satellite and aerial imagery for chlorophyll and nitrogen stress detection, but the optimal VI for maize chlorophyll and yield prediction under diverse management remains an open question. Moreover, non-linear relationships between VI and phenological/yield variables may not be well captured by linear regression, motivating ML approaches. This study addresses two gaps: (1) proposing a new RGB VI (MRBVI) that emphasizes the red band’s known sensitivity to chlorophyll; and (2) systematically comparing four supervised ML models (BP, SVM, RF, ELM) for yield prediction using multi-temporal VIs, with LOO validation and pixel-based scale-up. The work situates itself within agricultural remote sensing and precision agriculture, aiming to improve timeliness and scalability of chlorophyll estimation and yield forecasting.\", \"research_question_and_hypothesis\": \"Research questions: (1) Does a modified red–blue vegetation index (MRBVI) derived from UAV RGB imagery improve chlorophyll content estimation and yield prediction for maize compared to seven commonly used VIs? (2) Among backpropagation neural networks (BP), support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), and extreme learning machines (ELM), which ML model yields the most accurate plot-level yield predictions when trained on multi-temporal VIs?\\n\\nHypotheses: (H1) MRBVI will outperform existing VIs because emphasizing the red band’s sensitivity to chlorophyll will better capture canopy chlorophyll dynamics, reflected in higher R² for chlorophyll estimation and yield prediction. (H2) SVM will achieve the highest yield prediction accuracy due to its kernel-based non-linear mapping and robustness to high-dimensional inputs, followed by RF and ELM, with BP performing least well. (H3) VI–phenology relationships will strengthen as maize progresses from early to mid-late growth stages, with R² increasing from July 28 onward. Support for H1 would be higher R² and lower relative error for MRBVI than other VIs; support for H2 would be lower RMSE/MAE for SVM than BP, RF, and ELM; support for H3 would be increasing R² trends from mid-season onward.\", \"methodological_details\": \"Study site and design: The Eco-Agricultural Experimental Station (CAS), North China Plain (38.00°N, 116.40°E), semi-humid monsoon climate (mean annual temperature 12°C; precipitation ~480 mm/year). Twenty experimental plots (10 m × 8 m) with varying fertilizer treatments (N, P, K, straw, organic) were managed with adequate irrigation and fertilization at key stages (booting July 21, heading August 23, maturity September 15). The maize growth period spanned ~4 months (late June/early July to late September/early October).\\n\\nUAV data acquisition: DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2.0 with 5472 × 3648 px images and 8.8 mm focal lens. Four GCPs (white paint) were measured with RTK S86T to ensure geometric accuracy. Flights were conducted around 10:30 AM at 50 m altitude to minimize solar angle effects. Flight overlaps were set to 85% forward and 80% side (Altizure V4.7.0.196). Eleven flights occurred on July 7, 14, 22, 28; August 18, 25; September 1, 7, 14, 21, 30, 2019. Mosaics were generated with GSD 0.018 m.\\n\\nGround measurements: SPAD-502 chlorophyll readings were collected the same day after flights using a five-point method (center and four corners) per plot; plot-level SPAD values were averaged. Yields were measured at maturity by harvesting and weighing dry matter per plot.\\n\\nVegetation index computation: RGB bands were normalized (R = r/(r+g+b), G = g/(r+g+b), B = b/(r+g+b)). Eight VIs (E1–E8) were computed; E8 is MRBVI. For chlorophyll estimation, average VI per plot per date was regressed against SPAD using linear regression in MATLAB 2019b to compute R². For yield prediction, average VI per plot was regressed against plot yield. The authors also compared VI–SPAD dynamics across growth stages.\\n\\nML-based yield prediction: For each plot, eight VIs computed from subsample images (green pixel extraction via EXG-EXR method) were used as predictors; plot yield was the target. Models: BP (backpropagation neural network), SVM (support vector machine), RF (random forest), ELM (extreme learning machine). Training and evaluation used leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation. Performance metrics: RMSE, MAE, and AE (absolute error). RMSE and MAE were computed as standard formulas with n samples, M true yields, and P predicted yields. Pixel-based scale-up: pixel-wise VI maps from July 28–September 30 were input to trained models to produce yield maps.\\n\\nEthics/IRB: Not applicable; no human or animal subjects reported.\", \"procedures_and_architectures\": \"Vegetation indices: The study compared eight VIs (E1–E8), with E8 defined as MRBVI. The exact MRBVI formula is referenced in Table 2 but not provided in the text. All VIs were computed from normalized RGB bands (R, G, B). The authors emphasize that MRBVI enhances the red band’s contribution, leveraging its known sensitivity to chlorophyll content. For chlorophyll estimation, VI–SPAD relationships were assessed per growth stage; for yield prediction, VI–yield relationships were assessed per plot.\\n\\nGreen pixel extraction: Subsample images (20 plots × 11 dates = 220 images) were classified into green vs non-green pixels using EXG-EXR (EXG = 2G − R − B), to reduce background interference (e.g., soil). VIs were computed using only green pixels.\\n\\nMachine learning models: Four supervised models were trained with LOO cross-validation. Predictors were the eight VIs computed from each plot’s subsample images; the target was plot yield. The text states that SVM’s kernel function enables mapping to high-dimensional feature spaces, improving generalization for non-linear relationships. RF was noted for feature importance without explicit feature selection and robustness to partial feature loss, though overfitting is a known limitation. BP used gradient-based learning for multi-layer networks; ELM randomly set input–hidden weights and thresholds and solved for hidden–output weights analytically, offering faster training than BP. The study reports training times: BP 355.250 s; ELM 332.860 s. No hyperparameters, network architectures, kernel types, or random seeds are reported.\\n\\nScale-up: Trained models were applied to pixel-wise VI maps (July 28–September 30) to generate yield maps, enabling spatially explicit predictions across the field. Model outputs were compared to measured yields via scatterplots (with 15% error lines) and spatial maps.\", \"key_results\": \"Chlorophyll estimation: Across 11 growth stages, MRBVI achieved the highest average R² for chlorophyll estimation (0.462), outperforming seven other VIs: E1 0.235; E2 0.380; E3 0.295; E4 0.392; E5 0.391; E6 0.378; E7 0.451. Relative error (RE) for MRBVI was the lowest at 0.355. VI–SPAD relationships strengthened from mid-season onward; R² increased significantly from August 18 and exceeded 0.8 for chlorophyll and yield from July 28 to September 30. Early stages (July 7–22) showed weaker correlations, likely due to sparse canopy and background interference.\\n\\nYield prediction (VI–yield regression): Average R² between VI and yield across 11 dates was highest for MRBVI (0.570), followed by E7 (0.552), E5 (0.452), E4 (0.446), E2 (0.441), E6 (0.429), E3 (0.404), and E1 (0.336). The authors note that VI–yield relationships improved with growth stage, with significant increases from August 18.\\n\\nML yield prediction (LOO): Using eight VIs as predictors and plot yields as targets, SVM achieved the best performance: RMSE 1.099; MAE 0.886 g/hundred grain weight. RF followed with RMSE 1.146; MAE 0.925. ELM had RMSE 1.698; MAE 1.356. BP performed worst: RMSE 2.157; MAE 1.739. Scatterplots (Figure 7) showed all models within ~15% error bounds, with SVM closest to measured yields. Pixel-based scale-up (Figure 8) indicated SVM predictions most consistent with measured yields; RF exhibited greater spatial uncertainty despite lower RMSE/MAE than BP and ELM.\\n\\nTraining efficiency: ELM training was ~7% faster than BP (332.860 s vs 355.250 s). The authors attribute SVM’s superior performance to kernel-based non-linear mapping and robustness to high-dimensional inputs; RF’s robustness to partial feature loss is noted, though overfitting is a potential limitation.\\n\\nVI–SPAD dynamics: When comparing VI averages across 20 plots to normalized SPAD values, MRBVI had the smallest MAE (0.072) and AE (3.908), outperforming other VIs (e.g., E1 MAE 0.186; AE 9.037; E2 MAE 0.097; AE 4.978; E3 MAE 0.089; AE 4.582; E4 MAE 0.252; AE 12.031; E5 MAE 0.117; AE 5.838; E6 MAE 0.078; AE 4.240; E7 MAE 0.118; AE 6.004).\", \"interpretation_and_theoretical_implications\": \"The findings support the hypothesis that emphasizing the red band in a vegetation index improves chlorophyll estimation and yield prediction. MRBVI’s higher R² and lower relative error indicate that red-band sensitivity to chlorophyll content is a key driver of VI–phenology relationships in maize. The strengthening of VI–phenology correlations from mid-season onward aligns with canopy development and reduced background interference, underscoring the importance of timing in UAV-based monitoring.\\n\\nFor yield prediction, SVM’s superior performance suggests that kernel-based non-linear models effectively capture complex, multi-temporal VI–yield relationships. ELM’s speed advantage and competitive accuracy over BP highlight the practicality of single-pass learning for operational use. The results imply that integrating VI time series with non-linear ML can provide accurate, scalable yield forecasts, potentially informing precision nitrogen management and harvest planning. The approach could generalize to other crops where red-band chlorophyll sensitivity is pronounced, though validation across environments and seasons is needed.\", \"contradictions_and_limitations\": \"Early-stage performance was weak (R² < 0.4 for chlorophyll and yield), likely due to sparse canopy and background contamination despite green pixel extraction. The study used only 20 plots, limiting statistical power and external validity; no independent test set or external validation was reported, and LOO may overestimate performance. The exact MRBVI formula is not provided in the text (referenced in Table 2), hindering reproducibility. ML hyperparameters, network architectures, kernel types, and random seeds were not reported, preventing replication and assessment of overfitting. RF’s tendency to overfit is acknowledged, but no regularization or cross-validation beyond LOO is described. The field had varying fertilizer treatments, which could confound VI–yield relationships; no statistical controls for management differences are reported. The study focuses on a single site and year; climate and management variability may affect generalizability. Pixel-based scale-up results are promising but lack quantitative spatial error metrics.
