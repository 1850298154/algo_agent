CallToolResult(content=[TextContent(type='text', text="React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces   . Its main purpose is to provide a declarative and component-based programming model for creating interactive UIs .\n\n### Core Principles and Features\n*   **Declarative**: React allows you to design simple views for each state of your application, and it efficiently updates and renders only the necessary components when data changes . This approach makes code more predictable, easier to understand, and simpler to debug .\n*   **Component-Based**: React promotes building encapsulated components that manage their own state . These components can then be composed to create complex user interfaces . The logic for components is written in JavaScript, allowing for rich data to be passed through the application .\n*   **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: React is designed to be flexible and does not make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack . It can be used to develop new features without rewriting existing code . React can render on the server using Node.js and power mobile apps using React Native .\n\n### Key Packages\nThe React repository is a monorepo containing several packages :\n*   `react`: This is the core package that provides the public API, including hooks, components, and JSX runtime  .\n*   `react-dom`: This package provides the renderer for web browsers, handling DOM manipulation, event systems, and hydration .\n*   `react-reconciler`: This package implements React's core rendering algorithm, known as the Fiber architecture . It manages virtual DOM diffing, updates, and priority scheduling .\n*   `scheduler`: This package is responsible for cooperative task scheduling .\n\n## Notes\nThe provided context also mentions `react-refresh` , which is a runtime for Fast Refresh , and `react-devtools` , which provides debugging capabilities . While these are part of the React ecosystem, the core definition and purpose of React itself are primarily described by the `react` package and the overall project goals.\n\nWiki pages you might want to explore:\n- [Overview (facebook/react)](/wiki/facebook/react#1)\n\nView this search on DeepWiki: https://app.devin.ai/search/what-is-react-and-what-is-its_969e2489-7caf-4e6c-86c2-909513fd8976\n", annotations=None, meta=None)], structured_content={'result': "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces   .
